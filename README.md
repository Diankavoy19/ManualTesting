We would like you to test the CRUD operations for the following application: https://computer-database.gatling.io/computers. Your testing does not need to be limited to just functionality - we’d love to see your thought process on any UX and UI improvements.
Once completed, please organize your responses into three separate google documents and reply to this email with them. (attach the files or provide URLs)
